    <h3 class="basic"><b>How To Win</b></h3>
    <p>
        In order to 'win' Minecraft you need to go to the End dimension,<br>
        and defeat The Ender Dragon. Although to get there you will need<br>
        some gear and specific items to open a portal to there.
    </p>
    <h3 class="basic"><b>Ender-Eyes</b></h3>
    <p>
        To open a portal you need to get: Ender-pearls from Endermen;<br>
        Blaze-rods from blazes, then to craft them toghether.<br>
        Endermen are tall dark teleportinng figures found just about everywhere.<br>
        Blazes are hovering fiery being found exclusively in Nether-fortresses;<br>
        Rare structures found atop lava in the Nether dimension<br>
    </p>
    <h3 class="basic"><b>Getting To Nether</b></h3>
    <p>
        Not only is the nether a good place to find Endermen,<br>
        Its also the only place to find Blazes, so getting to it's<br>
        Important. To build a Nether-portal you need 10 obsidian;<br>
        place them in a rectangular shape. Then finally light the portal<br>
        on fire(preferably with a flint-and-steel).
