    <h3 class="basic"><b>Mojangs origins</b></h3>
    <p>
        Mojang Studios is a Swedish video game developer based in Stockholm.<br>
        The studio is best known for developing the sandbox and survival game Minecraft,<br>
        the best-selling video game of all time.<br>
        Mojang Studios was founded by the independent video game designer Markus Persson<br>
        in 2009 as Mojang Specifications for Minecraft's development. The studio inherited its name<br>
        from another video game venture Persson had left two years prior. Following the game's initial release,<br>
        Persson, in conjunction with Jakob Pors√©r, incorporated the business as Mojang AB in late 2010,<br>
        and they hired Carl Manneh as the company's chief executive officer.
